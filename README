The work is still under development and not ready yet.


Repo for IEEE 802.11p supported Raspberry Pi kernel.

The kernel is based on official RPI kernel, branch=rpi-4.18.y.

https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/tree/rpi-4.18.y

The 802.11p relevant code is based on several relevant works, e.g., 

http://linux-kernel.2935.n7.nabble.com/PATCH-0-4-802-11p-OCB-mode-td941310.html

https://github.com/p3n3troot0r/socketV2V



The code has been ran on RPI 3 B and RPI 3 B+.

For WIFI dongle, we used external dongle which supports freq range up to 5.825GHz.

To address to the freq difference (IEEE 802.11p requires 5.9GHz, however none of 

USB-Port dongle can support 5.9GHz), we adapt the code towards so called

"semi 802.11p", in the sense that it supports all features of 802.11p, within freq range

under 5.9GHz.
