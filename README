Repo for IEEE 802.11p supported Raspberry Pi kernel.

The kernel is based on official RPI kernel, branch=rpi-4.18.y.

The 802.11p relevant code is based on several relevant works, e.g., 

https://github.com/p3n3troot0r/socketV2V

https://ctu-iig.github.io/802.11p-linux/

The code has been ran on RPI 3 B and RPI 3 B+

For WIFI dongle, we used external dongle which supports freq range up to 5.8GHz.

To address to the freq difference (IEEE 802.11p requires 5.9GHz, however none of 

USB-Port dongle can support 5.9GHz), therefore we adapt the code towards so called

"semi 802.11p", in the sense that it support all features of 802.11p, within freq range

under 5.8GHz.
