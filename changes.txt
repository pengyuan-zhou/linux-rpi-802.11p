 * Description:	The purpose of this project was to develop an open-source
 *	DSRC stack built on top of 802.11P (IEEE-1609.x), based on raspberry
 *      pi kernel.
 *     
 * Operation Outside the Context of a BSS (OCB): the 802.11p links
 *       are operated without a Basic Service Set (BSS).  This means that
 *       the messages Beacon, Association Request/Response, Authentication
 *       Request/Response, and similar, are not used.
